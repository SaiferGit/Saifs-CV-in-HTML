### css media queries

We use the `@media` rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

- Always Design for Mobile First. Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices).

### border-box box-sizing

By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

- width + padding + border = actual width of an element
- height + padding + border = actual height of an element
- If you set `box-sizing: border-box`; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height.
